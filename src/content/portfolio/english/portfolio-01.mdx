## The Navigation Problem Every Dental Practice Faces

Traditional addresses are failing dental practices and patients alike. How many times have patients called your office frustrated because:

- **"I'm in the parking lot but can't find your suite"**
- **"GPS brought me to the wrong building"**
- **"Which floor are you on? I'm lost in the complex"**
- **"The map shows your location but I can't find the entrance"**

These navigation failures lead to missed appointments, patient frustration, and wasted staff time on directions instead of dental care.

## What is What3Words? The Simple Solution

[What3Words](https://what3words.com) has divided the entire world into 3-meter squares, each with a unique 3-word address. Instead of complicated addresses like "123 Main Street, Suite 450, Building B, 3rd Floor" - you get **///hoaxes.speedboat.healings**.

### How It Works:
- Every 3-meter square on Earth has a unique 3-word combination
- No confusion between similar street names or building numbers
- Works offline - crucial for areas with poor signal
- Integrated with major navigation apps (Google Maps, Apple Maps, Uber)

## How Reviews Become Location-Tethered with ReelViews

### The Traditional Review Problem:
- Google reviews aren't connected to specific office areas
- Patients can't review specific experiences (waiting room, consultation, treatment)
- No way to tie feedback to exact locations within your practice

### Our ReelView + What3Words Solution:
1. **Each office area gets its own 3-word address**
   - Waiting Room: ///comfortable.chairs.welcome
   - Consultation Room: ///discuss.treatment.plan
   - Operatory 1: ///bright.clean.comfort
   - Reception: ///friendly.greeting.helpful

2. **QR codes placed throughout your office** connect to specific ReelViews
3. **Patients scan, record 30-second video reviews** tied to exact locations
4. **Earn CAND$ rewards** for submitting ReelViews at different locations

## Complete Office Grid System for Maximum Feedback

### Transform Every Square Meter into Feedback Opportunity

- One generic "How did we do?" form
- No location-specific insights
- Low patient participation rates
- Vague, unactionable feedback

**Our What3Words Grid Solution:**
- **20+ specific location codes** throughout your practice
- **QR codes at each station** for instant ReelView recording

## Ready to Eliminate Navigation Frustration?

Stop losing patients to confusing addresses and start guiding them directly to your door with 3-word precision. While your competitors struggle with "Building B, Suite 400" confusion, you'll be the practice that patients find effortlessly every time.

**Transform your patient experience from frustrating to frictionless.**
