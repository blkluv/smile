# Transform Staff Performance with Gamified Reputation Scoring

## The Dental Staff Engagement Crisis

Dental practices face constant challenges with staff morale, retention, and performance measurement. Traditional review systems fail because:

- **Anonymous reviews** don't provide actionable feedback
- **No real-time performance tracking** for individual staff members
- **Limited recognition** for exceptional patient care
- **High staff turnover** in the dental industry (25% annually)
- **Difficulty identifying** top performers during hiring

## The SmileSats Solution: CANDY Points & Reputation Leaderboards

- **+75 CANDY** - Staff's branded ReelView gets 100+ views
