# Revolutionize Your Dental Marketing with TikTok-Powered Patient Reviews

## What Are UGC ReelView Reviews?

**UGC ReelView Reviews** transform traditional patient testimonials into engaging, location-verified TikTok videos that drive real business growth. Instead of static text reviews, patients create short video testimonials (ReelViews) using custom TikTok AR effects, mapped to your exact practice location using what3words technology.

### 🎬 How ReelViews Work:

1. **Patient Creates Video**: After treatment, patients scan a QR code at checkout
2. **AR Filter Enhancement**: They record a 30-60 second video using your practice's custom TikTok AR filter
3. **Location Verification**: The video is automatically tagged with your what3words address
4. **Instant Publication**: The ReelView goes live on TikTok with your practice tags
5. **Analytics Tracking**: You get real-time data on views, engagement, and conversions

## Understanding the Technology

### 📍 What is what3words?
**what3words** has divided the entire world into 3-meter squares, each with a unique 3-word address. For example:
- Your front door might be: `///smile.bright.confident`
- Your waiting room: `///comfort.calm.welcome`
- Your treatment chair: `///care.precise.gentle`

**Why this matters:** Instead of vague "New York City" locations, your ReelViews show up as coming from your exact practice location, boosting local SEO and proving authenticity.

### 🎭 TikTok AR Effects Explained
**AR (Augmented Reality) Effects** are interactive filters that overlay digital elements on real-world videos. For dental practices, this could include:
- "Smile Score" filters that rate dental aesthetics
- "Before/After" comparison tools
- Branded frames with your practice name and logo
- Interactive elements that make reviews fun and engaging

**Key Benefit:** AR effects generate **3-5x more engagement** than regular videos because they're interactive and shareable.

## The Marketing Revolution: Shift Your Budget from Traditional Ads to Patient Content

### 📊 Why TikTok Beats Google & Facebook Ads:

| Traditional Ads | UGC ReelViews |
|----------------|---------------|
| **$500-1000/month** on Google/FB | **$50-100/review** paid to patients |
| **Interruptive** (users skip ads) | **Authentic** (users seek out content) |
| **One-time use** | **Evergreen content** you can reuse |
| **Low trust** (seen as advertising) | **High trust** (real patient stories) |
| **Short shelf life** | **Continuous discovery** |

### 🎯 The Trust Factor: Why TikTok Reviews Convert Better

- **90%** of TikTok users say they discover new brands on the platform
- **TikTok reviews feel 83% more authentic** than Google reviews
- **Average watch time**: 45+ seconds vs. 5-second ad skips
